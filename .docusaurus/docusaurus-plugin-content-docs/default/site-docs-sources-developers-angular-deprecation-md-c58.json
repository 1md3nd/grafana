  "description": "Angular plugin support is deprecated, and it will be removed in a future release. There are still many community plugins that depend on Grafanaâ€™s angular plugin support for them to work. The same is true for many internal (private) plugins developed over the years by Grafana users. Grafana version 9 will have a server configuration option, global for the whole instance, that will control if angular plugin support is available or not. By default angular support is still enabled but this will soon change as we complete the migration of all angular code in the core product.",
