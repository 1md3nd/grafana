# Get started with Grafana alerting (draft)

This topic helps you quickly create a multi dimensional Grafana managed alert. It explains how to select different configuration options, and briefly explains the key components of alerting, like labels, contact points, and notification policies.

## Before you begin

- Familiarize yourself with some of the [fundamental concepts]({{< relref "./fundamentals/_index.md" >}}) of Grafana alerting. In particular, refer to [About Grafana alerting]({{< relref "./about-alerting.md" >}}).
- Verify that you are set up to use Grafana alerting. If you are on version 9.0, Grafana alerting is the default, unless you and your organization had decided to roll back to legacy alerting. For more information on migrating legacy alerts, refer to [Migrate to Grafana alerting]({{< relref "./migrating-alerts/_index.md" >}}).

## Create alert rule

Follow the instructions in the video available in Grafana Lab's Youtube channel and create your alert rule.
