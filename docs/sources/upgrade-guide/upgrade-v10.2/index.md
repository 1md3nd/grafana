## Technical notes

The deprecated `/playlists/{uid}/dashboards` API endpoint has been removed. Dashboard information can be retrieved from the `/dashboard/...` APIs. See GitHub PR [#75503](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/75503) for details.

The `PUT /api/folders/:uid` endpoint no longer supports modifying the folder's UID; UIDs are expected to be immutable. See GitHub PR [#74684](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/74684) for details.

In the Azure Monitor data source, the **Intersection** option has been replaced with a **Dashboard** option to reduce confusion around how time ranges work. This is a breaking change because we're removing support for **Intersection**, but it is replaced with an option that is nearly the same. The **Intersection** option will be migrated to **Dashboard** automatically. See GitHub PR [#74675](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/74675) for more details.

This version removes all components for the old panel header design. See more details in GitHub PR [#74196](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/74196).
