## Dashboards and visualizations

### Disconnect values in time series, trend, and state timeline visualizations

_Generally available in all editions of Grafana._

<!-- Nathan Marrs -->

You can now choose whether to set a threshold above which values in the data should be disconnected. This can be useful in cases where you have sensors that report a value at a set interval, but you want to disconnect the values when the sensor does not respond. This feature complements the existing [connect null values functionality]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/visualizations/time-series/#connect-null-values" >}}).

To learn more, refer to our [disconnect values documentation]({{< relref "../panels-visualizations/visualizations/time-series/#disconnect-values" >}}).
