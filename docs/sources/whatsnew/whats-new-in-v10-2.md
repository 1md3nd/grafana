## Calculate visualization min/max individually per field

<!-- Oscar Kilhed -->

_Generally available in Grafana_

When visualizing multiple fields with a wide spread of values, calculating the min/max value of the visualization based on all fields can hide useful details.

In this example in the stats panel, it's hard to get an idea of how the values of each series relates to the historical values of that series. The threshold of 10% is exceeded by the A-series even though the A-series is below 10% of its historical maximum.

Now, you can automatically calculate the min/max of each visualized field, based on the lowest and highest value of the individual field! This setting is available in the standard options in most visualizations.

In this example, using the same data, with the min and max calculated for each individual field, we get a much better understanding of how the current value relates to the historical values. The A-series no longer exceeds the 10% threshold, it is in fact at a historical low!

This is not only useful in the stat panel. Gauge panel, bar gauge, status history, table cells formatted by thresholds, and gauge table cells all benefit from this addition!
