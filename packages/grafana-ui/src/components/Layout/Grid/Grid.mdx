# Grid

The `Grid` component allows for the organized layout and alignment of content into a grid-based structure.

When a grid child needs to set a value to either `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start` or `grid-column-end` you should use the `GridItem`. The `GridItem` also has the `displayContents` prop that makes the item not occupy any space but passing the positioning props and keeps their children as elements of the grid. You can find an example on the [GridItemPosition story](/story/general-layout-grid--grid-items-position).

When there is no need to pass any prop to the children of the grid, you can just pass an array of elements to the Grid component as you can see in the rest of the story examples.

## Usage

### When to use

Use the Grid component when you want to create structured and organized layouts where content or elements need to be aligned in rows and columns for clarity and consistency.

### When not to use

Use the `Stack` component instead for these use cases:

- **Simple layouts:** When you need to arrange elements in a linear format, either vertically or horizontally.
- **Regular flow:** When you want a "regular" site flow but with standardized spacing between the elements.

Use the `Flex` component instead for these use cases:

- **Centering:** Perfect for centering elements both vertically and horizontally.
- **Dynamic Order:** Easily reorder elements for responsive layouts without changing code.
