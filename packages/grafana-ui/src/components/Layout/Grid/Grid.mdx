# Grid

The `Grid` component allows for the organized layout and alignment of content into a grid-based structure.

## Usage

### When to use

Use the Grid component when you want to create structured and organized layouts where content or elements need to be aligned in rows and columns for clarity and consistency.

### When not to use

Use the `Stack` component instead for these use cases:

- **Simple layouts:** When you need to arrange elements in a linear format, either vertically or horizontally.
- **Dynamic content:** When your content or elements have varying heights or widths and you want them to adapt to each item's size without predefined rows or columns.

Use the `Flex` component instead for these use cases:

- **Centering:** Perfect for centering elements both vertically and horizontally.
- **Dynamic Order:** Easily reorder elements for responsive layouts without changing code.
