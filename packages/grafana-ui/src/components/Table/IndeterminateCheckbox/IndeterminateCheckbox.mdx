# IndeterminateCheckbox for React Table

This Indeterminate Checkbox component has three states: unchecked, checked, and indeterminate.
In this indeterminate state, the checkbox appears as a box with a horizontal dash through it.
The indeterminate state is used on a select-all checkbox to indicate that one or more selectable
items in a table have been selected. This component is directly connected to React Table, which
will soon be implemented in Core. Used in combination with React Table's useRowSelect hook.

- https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useRowSelect. But it can be tweaked for use in
- non-React Table contexts by modifying the `useCheckboxes` hook.

# Usage

```jsx
export function ReactTable({ columns, data }: { columns: Column[]; data: any }) {
  const { getTableProps, getTableBodyProps, headerGroups, rows, prepareRow } = useTable(
    {
      columns,
      data,
    },
    useRowSelect,
    useCheckboxes
  );
  ...
```
